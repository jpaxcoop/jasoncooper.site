                <span className="text-pink-500 font-medium text-lg">Hello!</span> I'm a designer and developer looking for my next passion project. Do you have a web application that you need to constantly enhance with new features for your customers? Or maybe you have a vision where you're still working out the details? I can help in either case.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
            I can bring a lot of value to your organization: instead of waiting on detailed instructions or exact specifications, I can accelerate the development process by helping you create the specs, or by creating a proof-of-concept until exact specs are ready.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">Once we're up and running, I'm an effective leader who can manage projects and guide a team efficiently. And because I'm not a specialist, I can pitch in wherever it's needed: development, design, operations, analytics, presentations.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Please reach out to me and I'm happy to share my thoughts and experience, and listen to yours.
