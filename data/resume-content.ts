I can bring a lot of value to your organization by accelerating the development process with my intertwined design and development workflow.

Once we're up and running, I'm an effective leader who can manage projects and guide a team efficiently. And I can pitch in wherever it's needed: development, design, operations, analytics, presentations.

Please reach out to me and I'm happy to share my thoughts and experience, and listen to yours.`,

During our time together at Peerless Network, Jason accomplished this first as a solo designer and developer and then shifted gears to leading a team that handled multiple projects simultaneously.
        
Jason's well-rounded skill set—coding, interface design, graphic design, and even copy-writing—combined with his can-do, helpful attitude ensure that any project he is involved with will be a success. I highly recommend Jason for your team!”`,

As a team lead Jason ensures that the team is always moving forward and that the product is always improving. He is constantly looking for ways to improve a code base and never hesitates to make himself available when a team member is struggling to overcome an obstacle.

The effectiveness of Jason's leadership and his willingness to dive into any challenge our team faced allowed us to grow a prototype application into a core component of our company's business operations.

Jason would be a great asset to any engineering team and I am thankful for having had the opportunity to work with him.”`,

The user interface is informed by that philosophy - the process and controls should be so obvious that the need for instruction or documentation is almost redundant (but should stil be present!).

With my marketing background, I understand and appreciate brand identity and standards. I have experience branding all sorts of assets, including applications. I'm careful to make sure the UI design represents the brand without interfering with the connection between the user and the application.`,

- Millions of dollars in revenue flowed through the Portal each year, with almost no work required by the voice engineering team.

- I wore the hats of team lead, designer, and developer. I worked closely with the voice product team, customer management leadership, and technical support to design features to support customers and business units across the company.`,

- This included integration between platforms (marketing automation, CRM, online chat, email, reporting, WordPress, webcasting, video), realtime asset deployment through API calls, web and email personalization, interactive web content, custom reporting dashboards, and custom partner data sharing portals with OAuth-managed access.

- I implemented front-end frameworks to rapidly develop branded, responsive, interactive, usable, and aesthetically pleasing front ends to these capabilities. I also provided clear, illustrated, web-based documentation.

- My work was so effective and efficient the company canceled plans to add two more technology managers to the team.

- The result was a sales pipeline with increased leads volume and more visibility into the customer journey.`,
