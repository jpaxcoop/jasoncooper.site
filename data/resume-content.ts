I can bring a lot of value to your organization by accelerating the development process with my intertwined design and development workflow.

Once we're up and running, I'm an effective leader who can manage projects and guide a team efficiently. And I can pitch in wherever it's needed: development, design, operations, analytics, presentations.

Please reach out to me and I'm happy to share my thoughts and experience, and listen to yours.`,

Jason's well-rounded skill set—coding, interface design, graphic design, and even copy-writing—combined with his can-do, helpful attitude ensure that any project he is involved with will be a success. I highly recommend Jason for your team!”`,

As a team lead Jason ensures that the team is always moving forward and that the product is always improving. He is constantly looking for ways to improve a code base and never hesitates to make himself available when a team member is struggling to overcome an obstacle.

The effectiveness of Jason's leadership and his willingness to dive into any challenge our team faced allowed us to grow a prototype application into a core component of our company's business operations.

Jason would be a great asset to any engineering team and I am thankful for having had the opportunity to work with him.”`,

I often work directly with stakeholders to collect requirements and learn about the systems and processes the new application will integrate with. But it's always helpful to collaborate with a product manager, who can bring a great deal of content matter expertise.`,

In my experience, much of it is anecdotal and the only hard data comes from CRM platforms or legacy applications. I would enjoy the chance to conduct user research, but to this point budget and time constraints have not allowed for it.

My work in the B2B space has taught me the ideal user experience is intuitive, fast, and risk-free (meaning the user can always go back, undo, or delete). The user interface is informed by that philosophy - the process and controls should be so obvious that the need for instruction or documentation is almost redundant (but should stil be present!).

With my marketing background, I have an understanding (and appreciation) for brand identity and standards. I have a lot of experience applying a brand to all sorts of assets, including applications. I'm careful to make sure the UI design represents the brand without interfering with the connection between the user and the application.`,

To this end I've used **Copilot in VS Code, the Cursor IDE, and of course ChatGPT**.

I've experimented with the **OpenAI API** (see the **Role Matcher**) and **AI image generation**. My recent [HAL9000 project](http://localhost:3000/projects/hal9000) was a deep dive into **voice model training, vocoder optimization, and working with LLMs**.`,

Over the years, the Peerless Portal drastically increased its scope - upstream with quote-building and integration with Salesforce, and downstream with product usage reporting and support ticket management.

I relied on front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and WPBakery Page Builder to rapidly develop branded, responsive, interactive, usable, and aesthetically pleasing front ends to these capabilities.
